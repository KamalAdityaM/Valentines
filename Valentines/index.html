        My sweet Roro,
        <br>
A year ago,
<br> in the realm of the unknown,<br>
Life shifted,<br> love brightly shown.<br>
Once a skeptic,<br> now fully grown,<br>
7 months with you,<br> my heart's overthrown.
<br><br>
Against love's grand displays,<br>
I stood firm in my distant ways.<br>
But your laughter's grace,<br>
Turned my world into a lavender haze.<br>
<br>
Squirrels, gol gappe, aloo parathe delight,<br>
In your world, everything feels just right.<br>
Each morning, with sheer delight,<br>
I wake up to you, my heart taking flight.<br>
<br>
In this haven of love, laughter, and glee,<br>
I found my home, my heart's decree.<br>
Grateful for you, my sweet Ro,<br>
With every beat, my love does grow.<br>
<br>

	In a world where stars do shine,<br>
A love story, so divine.<br>
Hearts entwine, our souls align,<br>
In this realm of sweet valentine.<br>
<br>
Moonlit walks, moments clandestine,<br>
Feelings deep, like aged wine.<br>
Whispers soft, a love design,<br>
Leading to a question, so benign.<br>
<br>
Underneath the pale moon's sign,<br>
With every beat, your name I sign.<br>
In this rhythm, so serpentine,<br>
Will you be my valentine?<br><br><br>
      </div>
  </body>
